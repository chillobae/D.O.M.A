# D.O.M.A

DOMA is an interactive chatbot project that ues NLTK and LangChain to interact with the user. 
I built this project from scratch being inspired by openAI's chatGPT and wanted to make a clone of it🤖🌐
<br>It's Still in Development, so i will be adding constan changes each time i learn something new.🐼
<br>
<br> As of now, the chatbot extracts texts from an 'N' number of databse files (*pdf format in this case*), preprocesses them an then analyses the user string and compares it wit the database to give an output🖥💽
<br>DOMA also is able to use google-search incase of an irrelevant data input. So, in every case it will provide an Output (*This part is still in development rn tho*) 🌐📥
<br>*Also experimenin with integrating Machine Lerning into the project via Ensemble Methods*
